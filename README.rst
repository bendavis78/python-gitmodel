A distributed, versioned data store for Python
----------------------------------------------

python-gitmodel is a framework for persisting objects using Git for versioning
and remote syncing.

Why?
----
According to `Git's README`_, Git is a "stupid content tracker". That means you
aren't limited to storing source code in git. The goal of this project is to
provide an object-level interface to use git as a schema-less data store, as
well as tools that take advantage of git's powerful versioning capabilities.

python-gitmodel allows you to model your data using python, and provides an
easy-to-use interface for storing that data as git objects.

python-gitmodel is based on `libgit2`_, a pure C implementation of the Git core
methods. This means that instead of calling git commands via shell, we get
to use git at native speed.

What's so great about it?
-------------------------
* Schema-less data store
* Never lose data. History is kept forever and can be restored using git tools.
* Branch and merge your production data

  * python-gitmodel can work with different branches
  * branch or tag snapshots of your data
  * experiment on production data using branches, for example, to test a migration

* Ideal for content-driven applications

Example usage
-------------
Below we'll cover a use-case for a basic flat-page CMS.

Basic model creation: 

.. code:: python

  from gitmodel.workspace import Workspace
  from gitmodel import fields
  
  ws = Workspace('path/to/my-repo/.git')

  class Page(ws.GitModel):
      slug = fields.SlugField() 
      title = fields.CharField()
      content = fields.CharField()
      published = fields.BooleanField(default=True)

The Workspace can be thought of as your git working directory. It also acts as
the "porcelain" layer to pygit2's "plumbing". In contrast to a working
directory, the Workspace class does not make use of the repository's INDEX and
HEAD files, and instead keeps track of these in memory.

Saving objects:

.. code:: python

  page = Page(slug='example-page', title='Example Page')
  page.content = '<h2>Here is an Example</h2><p>Lorem Ipsum</p>'
  page.save()

  print(page.id)
  # abc99c394ab546dd9d6e3381f9c0fb4b

By default, objects get an auto-ID field which saves as a python UUID hex 
(don't confuse these with git hashes). You can easily customize which field in
your model acts as the ID field, for example:

.. code:: python

  class Page(ws.GitModel):
      slug = fields.SlugField(id=True)
  
  # OR

  class Page(ws.GitModel):
      slug = fields.SlugField()

      class Meta:
          id_field = 'slug'
 
Objects are not committed to the repository by default. They are, however,
written into the object database as trees and blobs. The ``Workspace.index``
object is a ``pygit2.Tree`` that holds the uncommitted data. It's analagous to
Git's index, except that the pointer is stored in memory. 

Creating commits is simple:

.. code:: python
  
  oid = page.save(commit=True, message='Added an example page')
  commit = ws.repo[oid] # a pygit2.Commit object
  print(commit.message)

You can access previous commits using pygit2, and even view diffs between two
versions of an object.

.. code:: python
  
  # walking commits
  for commit in ws.walk():
      print("{}: {}".format(commit.hex, commit.message)) 
  
  # get a diff between two commits
  head_commit = ws.branch.commit
  prev_commit_oid = head_commit.parents[0]
  print(prev_commit.diff(head_commit))

Objects can be easily retrieved by their id:

.. code:: python
  
  page = Page.get('example-page')
  print(page.content)

 
Caveat Emptor
-------------
Git doesn't perform very well on its own. If you need your git-backed data to
perform well in a production environment, you need to get it a "wingman". 
Since python-gitmodel can be used in a variety of ways, it's up to you to
decide the best way to optimize it.

Status
------
This project is no longer under active development.

TODO
----
* Caching?
* Indexing?
* Query API?
* Full documentation

python-gitmodel was inspired by Rick Olson's talk, "`Git, the Stupid NoSQL 
Database`_" and Paul Downman's `GitModel`_ for ruby.
